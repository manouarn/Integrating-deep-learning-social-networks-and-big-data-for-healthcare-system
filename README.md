Chest X-ray image classification

This paper aims to propose a deep learning model based on big data for the healthcare system to predict social
network data. Social network users post large amounts of healthcare information on a daily basis and at the
same time hospitals and medical laboratories store very large amounts of healthcare data, such as X-rays. The
authors provide an architecture that can integrate deep learning, social networks, and big data. Deep learning is
one of the most challenging areas of research and is becoming increasingly popular in the health sector. It uses
deep analysis to extract knowledge with optimum precision. The proposed architecture consists of three layers:
the deep learning layer, the big data layer, and the social networks layer. The big data layer includes data for
health care, such as X-ray images. For the deep learning layer, three Convolution Neuronal Network models are
proposed for X-ray image classification. As a result, social network layer users can access the proposed system
to predict their X-ray image posts.
Keywords: big data, deep learning, healthcare system, social network, X-ray image.
